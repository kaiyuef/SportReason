The family later moved to Brunswick, Georgia.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Love III’s family includes his younger brother, Mark Love, who has also been involved in the golfing world, though more prominently in the business and management side of the sport.\n\n### Early Career\n\nDavis Love attended Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, where he showcased his golfing prowess by winning the Georgia State Championship as a high school senior, setting a single-round record of 66.\n\nHis exceptional skills on the golf course earned him a scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he played college golf from 1983 to 1985.\n\nHe accumulated 6 titles throughout his collegiate career. At UNC, Love was a 3-time All-American golfer who won the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) tournament championship in 1984.\n\nIn 1985, Love’s amateur career reached a significant milestone when he played on the USA Walker Cup team, representing his country in one of the most prestigious amateur golf competitions.\n\n### Professional Career\n\nAfter turning professional in 1985, Love quickly established himself as a force on the PGA Tour with his first victory at the MCI Heritage Golf Classic in 1987.\n\nOver the years, he accumulated 21 PGA Tour victories, including a major championship win at the 1997 PGA Championship, which solidified his status as one of the elite players of his time.\n\nLove’s career highlights include two wins at THE PLAYERS Championship in 1992 and 2003.\n\nDue to its prestige and the strong field it attracts, the PLAYERS Championship is often regarded as the fifth major.\n\nHis success at the MCI Heritage Golf Classic was particularly notable.

His father, who was a former pro and nationally recognized golf instructor, introduced him to the game. His mother is also an avid low-handicap golfer. His father was killed in a 1988 plane crash.[\\[7\\]][\\[8\\]]\n\nLove attended high school in [Brunswick, Georgia], and graduated from its [Glynn Academy] in 1982.\n\nAmateur career\n------\n\n\\[[edit]\\]\n\nLove played college golf at the [University of North Carolina] in [Chapel Hill], where he was a three-time [All-American] and all-[Atlantic Coast Conference]. He won six titles during his collegiate career, including the ACC tournament championship as a sophomore in 1984.[\\[9\\]]\n\nProfessional career\n-------\n\n\\[[edit]\\]\n\nIn 1985, Love turned professional. He earned his PGA Tour card late in the season at [1985 PGA Tour Qualifying School]. It was his first attempt at [PGA Tour Qualifying school] on his first attempt. He quickly established himself on the [PGA Tour], winning his first tour event in [1987] at the [MCI Heritage Golf Classic] at [Harbour Town Golf Links]. He would later win this event four more times, setting a record for the most victories in the tournament.\n\nIn 1994, Love founded Love Golf Design, a golf course architecture company with his younger brother and caddie, Mark Love. The company has been responsible for the design of several courses throughout the southeast United States. Completed in 1997, Ocean Creek is his first signature course and is located on [Fripp Island], [South Carolina].[\\[10\\]] Love also designed the Dunes course at Diamante in [Cabo San Lucas], [Mexico], which is ranked among _[Golf Magazine]'_s Top 100 courses in the world.[\\[11\\]]\n\nLove was a consistent contender and winner on the PGA Tour in the 1990s and early 2000s, but the most memorable win came at the [1997 PGA Championship], his only major championship victory. It was played at [Winged Foot Golf Club] near [New York City], and just four players in the field finished under-par for the week. Love's winning score was 11-under-par, five strokes better than runner-up [Justin Leonard]. When Love sank his birdie putt on the final hole of the championship, it was under the arc of a rainbow, which appeared as he walked up to the 18th green. In the telecast, [CBS Sports] announcer [Jim Nantz] made the connection between the rainbow and Love's late father, Davis Love Jr., who was a well-known and beloved figure in the golf world.[\\[12\\]][\\[13\\]] This victory was the last major championship win achieved with a [wooden]\\-headed driver.[\\[14\\]]\n\nLove has had success late in his regular career.

It’s seen in a PGA Tour event he hosts in his adopted hometown that has raised more than $25 million in charity, numerous other charitable efforts both seen and unseen, being honored with the PGA Tour’s Payne Stewart Award that counts character more than birdies, signing every autograph and posing for every picture or merely throwing a chain saw in the back of his truck and cutting fallen tree limbs down so his neighbors can get out after a hurricane.\n\nIt also can be found in 35 years of marriage, two children and three grandchildren and quite simply being beloved for being himself, from the Golden Isles to the First Coast.\n\n30 years later: [Davis Love III still cherishes memory of proving a pair of fans wrong]\n\nIt's gonna be packed: [Time to move fast for Players tickets, parking as return to full capacity creating high demand]\n\nNeed a break? [Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.]\n\nSaban surprise: [Justin Thomas returns to the scene of his biggest 2021 victory — and gets a surprise visit]\n\nTwo-time major champion Zach Johnson spoke for the two dozen or so professionals who have set up home bases on St. Simons Island, Ga., partly due to the influence of the man they call, with humor and affection, \"Uncle Davis.\"\n\n\"The more I can be around him, the better off I'll be,\" Johnson said about Davis Love III, golfer, businessman, architect, philanthropist, husband, father, grandfather, mentor and friend.\n\nSynonymous with The Players  \n-----------\n\nThere have been five men to win The Players Championship twice at the Players Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass: Love, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington, Hal Sutton and Tiger Woods. Love won his titles nine years apart, the longest time between victories, and came from behind in both with final rounds of 67 in 1992 and a record closing round for a winner of 64 in 20003.\n\nThis year is the 30th anniversary of Love's first Players victory, which was the fourth of his 21 PGA Tour titles and his first victory in a huge event with an elite field. He had to catch and pass Nick Faldo in the final round, no small feat.\n\nIn a way, it was his coming-out party but Love already had won twice at Hilton Head and had been tabbed as one of the rising Tour stars since he was a three-time All-American and Walker Cup player at North Carolina.\n\n![Image 4: Davis Love III waves to fans as he walks to the pin after chipping his ball from the gallery behind the eighth green into the hole for birdie and the lead during the final round of the 1992 Players Championship. He went on to win by four shots. [Bob Self/Florida Times-Union]]\n\nLove is tied with Jay Haas for the most career starts on The Players with 29, is tied for second with Sergio Garcia for the most top-10s with seven and has made the fourth-most cuts with 19.\n\nLove even went to The Players before turning pro: the first date with his wife outside of the beach or a fast-food meal on St. Simons Island was to take her for a day at the 1982 Players Championship.\n\n\"She came out in flip-flops and I showed her around the course and said, 'this is what I'm going to do for a living,'\" Love said. \"She told me, 'yeah, right.'\"\n\nNow settled into a life where his most serious competitive desires will be found on the PGA Tour Champions (and if he finally breaks free of a series of injuries), the only role this week at The Players for the 57-year-old Love will be ceremonial: he's the World Golf Hall of Fame member who will present former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem at the March 9 induction ceremony at the PGA Tour Global Home.\n\n![Image 5: Davis Love III has made his biggest impact in golf by winning The Players Championship twice and guiding the U.S. to victory in the 2016 Ryder Cup.]\n\nLove's 36-year association with the Tour's gold standard event, his two titles and the dashing and daring manner in which he won them has often led to some confusion: as iconic a figure as he is on the Golden Isles of Georgia, some fans mistakenly think he lives in Jacksonville or Ponte Vedra Beach.\n\n\"It's always felt like a home game,\" Love said of The Players. \"It's so close to St. Simons. Plus, I've been on the \\[PGA Tour Policy\\] board so many times \\[five\\] that I'm here a lot. And Dad brought us down here to play all the time when Mark \\[his brother and former caddie\\] and I were kids. It was a nice little trip for us. We'd go play the Sawgrass Country Club, then the new course.\"\n\nLove's comfort zone  \n-------\n\nThe “new course” being the Stadium, and Love quickly became enamored with the challenges of the Pete Dye design — the asymmetrical lines off fairways, the forced carries over water, pot bunkers, undulating fairways and greens — a version of Dye's Harbour Town Golf Links on Hilton Head Island, S.C., where Love has won five times.\n\n\"I loved Pete Dye courses, loved the challenge, loved the grasses,\" Love said.\n\n![Image 6: Davis Love III is greeted by his wife Robin and their 9-year-old son Dru after he won his second Players Championship in 2003.]\n\nLove tied for 14th in The Players in his first attempt, in 1986. He then had some stumbles, with two missed cuts and a disqualification in 1988 for signing an incorrect scorecard but when he passed Faldo with a series of clutch putts and short-game shots in 1992, Love cemented his status as one of the Tour's biggest stars. He won three times that year and finished second to Fred Couples on the money list.\n\n\"Davis' game fit that course as well as anyone I ever saw,\" Couples said.\n\nFred Funk, another past Players champion, said the way to conquer the Stadium Course and win The Players is to not back down from Dye's design.\n\n\"Pete designs courses that are visually intimidating ... he wants you to be intimidated,\" Funk said. \"Davis never got intimidated by anything. He was successful on that course early and success kept breeding success.\"\n\nLove didn't want to get into the debate about whether The Players should be considered a major championship but he said when it comes time to tee it up and play 72 holes on a championship course, the tournament doesn't take a back seat to any challenge.\n\n\"The biggest thing to most players, even back then, is how stron",
