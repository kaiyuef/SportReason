The 1983 series was best-of-five but evidence indicates only 3 games were played, suggesting a 3-0 sweep by the Philadelphia Phillies. The 2008 and 2009 series were best-of-seven and went 5 games, with the Philadelphia Phillies winning both series 4-1. Counting the series won by the Philadelphia Phillies (1983, 2008, 2009) gives a total of 3.", "answer": 3, "seed_id": 29, "variant_id": 1, "question_category": "multi-table + multi text"}, "question_category": "multi-table + multi text"}

[ I ] His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted , and considered a foundational concept in science . In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace , he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection , in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding . Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history , and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey . Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species . By the 1870s , the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact . However , many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection , and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution . Darwin 's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences , explaining the diversity of life . Darwin 's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh ; instead , he helped to investigate marine invertebrates . Studies at the University of Cambridge ( Christ 's College ) encouraged his passion for natural science . His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell 's conception of gradual geological change , and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author . Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage , Darwin began detailed investigations , and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection .", "reason": "Provides the death year for the namesake.", "type": "text", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Charles_Darwin", "title": "Charles Darwin"}, {"id": "text_005906_chunk_07", "content": "The Dazai Osamu Prize ( 太宰治賞 ) is a Japanese literary prize named for novelist Dazai Osamu ( 1909-1948 ) .

[ b ] Born out of wedlock to a notary , Piero da Vinci , and a peasant woman , Caterina , in Vinci , in the region of Florence , Italy , Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Italian painter Andrea del Verrocchio . Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan , and he later worked in Rome , Bologna and Venice . He spent his last three years in France , where he died in 1519 . Leonardo is renowned primarily as a painter . The Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most popular portrait ever made . The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is regarded as a cultural icon as well . Salvator Mundi was sold for a world record $ 450.3 million at a Christie 's auction in New York , 15 November 2017 , the highest price ever paid for a work of art . Leonardo 's paintings and preparatory drawings - together with his notebooks , which contain sketches , scientific diagrams , and his thoughts on the nature of painting - compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary Michelangelo . Although he had no formal academic training , many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the Universal Genius or Renaissance Man , an individual of unquenchable curiosity and feverishly inventive imagination .

The city , located on the Potomac River bordering Maryland and Virginia , is one of the most visited cities in the world , with more than 20 million tourists annually . The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast .

The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district , which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria . The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital . In 1846 , Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia , including the city of Alexandria ; in 1871 , it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District .

This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the path of the ball and either catching it or directing it away from the vicinity of the goal line . Within the penalty area goalkeepers are able to use their hands , making them ( outside throw-ins ) the only players on the field permitted to handle the ball .

Goalkeepers play an important role in directing on field strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch , giving them a unique perspective on play development . The goalkeeper is the only required position of a team . If they are injured or sent off , a substitute goalkeeper has to take their place , otherwise an outfield player must take the ejected keeper 's place in goal .

Tallinn , first mentioned in 1219 , received city rights in 1248 , but the earliest human settlements date back 5,000 years . The first recorded claim over the land was laid by Denmark in 1219 , after a successful raid of Lyndanisse led by king Valdemar II , followed by a period of alternating Scandinavian and Teutonic rulers . Due to its strategic location , the city became a major trade hub , especially from the 14th to the 16th century , when it grew in importance as part of the Hanseatic League . Tallinn 's Old Town is one of the best preserved medieval cities in Europe and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

The project became more formalized with the creation of a website in 1993 , and followed up by a series of books starting in 2000 , authored by Wendy Northcutt . The criterion for the awards states , In the spirit of Charles Darwin , the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives . Darwin Award winners eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner , thereby improving our species ' chances of long-term survival . Accidental self-sterilization also qualifies ; however , the site notes : Of necessity , the award is usually bestowed posthumously . The candidate is disqualified , though , if innocent bystanders , who might have contributed positively to the gene pool , are killed in the process . The logical problem presented by award winners who may have already reproduced is not addressed in the selection process due to the difficulty of ascertaining if a person has or does not have children . People who have somehow miraculously survived their suicidal idiocy can be given an Honorable Mention if their attempted act of self removal is deemed worthy ( and humorous ) , i.e . they tried their best . The Darwin Awards books state that an attempt is made to disallow known urban legends from the awards , but some older winners have been grandfathered to keep their awards .

Linebackers are members of the defensive team , and line up approximately three to five yards ( 4 m ) behind the line of scrimmage , behind the defensive linemen , and therefore back up the line . Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a two-point stance ( as opposed to the defensive linemen , who put one or two hands on the ground for a three-point stance or four-point stance before the ball is snapped ) . The goal of the linebacker is to provide either extra run defense or extra pass defense based on the particular defensive play being executed . Another key play of the linebacker position is blitzing . A blitz occurs when a linebacker acts as an extra pass rusher running into any exposed gap .
