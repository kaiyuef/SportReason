        "Output": "I need to figure out how many years after turning pro Davis Love III achieved his highest ranking. Okay, first things first, I need to know when he turned pro and what his highest ranking was and when that happened.\n\nI know that Davis Love III is a professional golfer, but I'm not exactly sure when he turned pro. I think it was in the 1980s, but I'm not sure about the exact year. As for his highest ranking, I believe he reached as high as number 4 in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nLet me try to find out the exact years. I recall that Davis Love III turned pro in 1985. I think he graduated from the University of Georgia in 1985 and turned pro that year. Is that correct? I should verify that.\n\nAssuming he turned pro in 1985, I need to find out when he achieved his highest ranking of number 4. I think this happened in the early 1990s, maybe around 1992 or 1993. I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up his career statistics to get accurate information. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the internet right now, so I'll have to rely on my memory.\n\nLet me think about his major achievements. I know he won the PGA Championship in 1997, but that's probably after his highest ranking. I think his peak period was in the early to mid-1990s.\n\nI recall that in 1992, he had a good year, winning the Memorial Tournament and finishing in the top 10 in several majors. Maybe his ranking was at its highest around then.\n\nAlternatively, in 1995, he won the Buick Classic and played well in other tournaments. Perhaps his highest ranking was in that year.\n\nWait, I seem to be guessing here. Maybe I should consider that his highest ranking was number 4, and I need to find out in which year he achieved that.\n\nLet me consider that his highest ranking of number 4 was in 1996. If that's the case, and he turned pro in 1985, then the number of years between turning pro and achieving his highest ranking would be 1996 minus 1985, which is 11 years.\n\nBut I need to confirm if he indeed reached number 4 in 1996.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was in 1997, the year he won the PGA Championship. If that's the case, then it would be 1997 minus 1985, which is 12 years.\n\nWait, I need more precise information here. Maybe I should look at his official world ranking history.\n\nSince I can't look it up now, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I remember.\n\nI think Davis Love III's highest ranking was number 4, and he achieved that in 1996. So, if he turned pro in 1985, that would be 11 years later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it was 1995. If it was 1995, then it would be 1995 minus 1985, which is 10 years.\n\nI need to decide between 10 and 11 years.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nI know that Tiger Woods turned pro in 1996 and dominated the sport, so perhaps before Tiger's arrival, there were other players like Davis Love III who had higher rankings.\n\nIf Tiger turned pro in 1996, then Davis Love III's highest ranking of number 4 might have been before that, maybe in 1995.\n\nSo, if he achieved his highest ranking in 1995, and turned pro in 1985, that would be 10 years.\n\nAlternatively, if it was in 1996, it would be 11 years.\n\nI need to make a choice here.\n\nMaybe I should consider his major wins. He won the PGA Championship in 1997, but I'm not sure if that was the year he peaked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps his peak was earlier, in the early 1990s.\n\nWait, I recall that in the Official World Golf Ranking, Davis Love III's highest rank was indeed number 4, and it was achieved in 1995.\n\nIf that's accurate, then the number of years from turning pro in 1985 to reaching number 4 in 1995 would be 10 years.\n\nTherefore, my answer should be 10.\n\nBut I need to confirm if he turned pro in 1985 and reached number 4 in 1995.\n\nAlternatively, if he turned pro in 1984, then it would be 11 years.\n\nWait, let's check his amateur status.\n\nI think Davis Love III graduated from the University of Georgia in 1985 and turned pro that year.\n\nSo, 1985 is likely the year he turned pro.\n\nAnd if his highest ranking was in 1995, then it's 10 years.\n\nAlternatively, if it was in 1996, it would be 11 years.\n\nI need to decide based on my best memory.\n\nI think it's 10 years.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is \\boxed{10}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{10}",
