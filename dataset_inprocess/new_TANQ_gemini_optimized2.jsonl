For 1977, the game times are 2:35, 2:14, 2:59, and 2:39, which convert to 155, 134, 179, and 159 minutes. For 1978, the times are 2:37, 2:06, 2:18, and 2:53, converting to 157, 126, 138, and 173 minutes. For 2008, the times are 2:36, 3:33, 2:57, 3:44, and 3:14, converting to 156, 213, 177, 224, and 194 minutes. For 2009, the times are 4:02, 3:05, 3:12, 3:44, and 3:40, converting to 242, 185, 192, 224, and 220 minutes.

    "question": "Sort the New York Yankees' World Series victories by the number of games played, from lowest to highest, using the year as a tie-breaker (earlier years first). What is the number of games played in the third series in this sorted list?",
    "reasoning": "To answer this, we first identify several World Series won by the New York Yankees and the number of games played in each. We found victories in 1932 (4 games), 1938 (4 games), 1998 (4 games), 1941 (5 games), 2000 (5 games), and 1996 (6 games). We sort these victories based on the number of games played in ascending order. When there's a tie in the number of games, we use the year to break the tie, sorting earlier years first. This results in the sorted list: 1932 (4 games), 1938 (4 games), 1998 (4 games), 1941 (5 games), 2000 (5 games), 1996 (6 games). The third series in this sorted list is the 1998 World Series, which had 4 games.",

In 1990, the pole time was 1:21.314. In 1991, the pole time was 1:20.344. Convert these times to seconds: 1 minute and 21.314 seconds is 60 + 21.314 = 81.314 seconds. 1 minute and 20.344 seconds is 60 + 20.344 = 80.344 seconds.
