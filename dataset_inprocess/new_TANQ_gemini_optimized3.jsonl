Although John Hufnagel is mentioned as an ex-coach/special advisor, his coaching tenure isn't as explicitly defined in a range as the others in the provided infoboxes. We will focus on those with clear coaching date ranges in the infoboxes or direct text mention of coaching. 2. Filter this list to include only those whose Grey Cup wins are mentioned in the evidence. Dave Dickenson's Grey Cup win (as a player) is mentioned. Les Lear's Grey Cup wins (as a player) are mentioned. Jim Duncan's Grey Cup win is not mentioned in the evidence. Thus, the individuals are Dave Dickenson and Les Lear. 3. Find the birth year for each identified individual. Dave Dickenson was born in 1973. Les Lear was born in 1918. 4. Determine the oldest and youngest from this list and calculate the difference in their birth years. The oldest is Les Lear (1918) and the youngest is Dave Dickenson (1973).

    "reasoning": "To find the highest attendance, I need to look at the attendance figures for all the games played between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Championship Series provided in the evidence.  I will examine the attendance column in each table, identify the maximum attendance for each series, and then find the overall maximum across all the series. The attendance figures are:\n- 2008 NLCS: 45,839, 45,883, 56,800, 56,800, 56,800 (Max: 56,800)\n- 2009 NLCS: 56,000, 56,000, 45,721, 46,157, 46,214 (Max: 56,000)\n- 1977 NLCS: 55,968, 55,973, 63,719, 64,924 (Max: 64,924)\n- 1978 NLCS: 63,460, 60,642, 55,043, 55,124 (Max: 63,460)\nComparing the maximums from each series (56,800, 56,000, 64,924, 63,460), the highest attendance recorded is 64,924.",

Both of these years (1990 and 1991) are equal to or before 1992. Other Monaco Grand Prix races around this period are also mentioned (e.g., 1987, 1989, 1992, 1993), but the evidence provided only explicitly lists Senna as the winner for 1990 and 1991 among the relevant years.

I will only count the races that took place in 2016 or any subsequent year based on the available evidence.  The provided evidence includes results for the 2015 and 2016 Canadian Grands Prix. In the 2015 race, Lewis Hamilton finished first. However, 2015 is before 2016, so this win does not meet the condition. In the 2016 race, Lewis Hamilton also finished first. Since 2016 is included in the condition \"2016 or later\", this win is counted. No other Canadian Grand Prix results for 2016 or later are available in the provided evidence that show Lewis Hamilton winning. Therefore, Lewis Hamilton won the Canadian Grand Prix 1 time in 2016 or later, based on the given information.",
