From 2014-10-05 to 2014-12-31 there are 87 days (26 in Oct + 30 in Nov + 31 in Dec). From 2015-01-01 to 2015-09-27 there are 270 days (31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+27). The total number of days between 2014-10-05 and 2015-09-27 is 87 + 270 = 357.",

    "reasoning": "To find the longest game duration, I need to identify the National League Championship Series that featured both the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies. The evidence indicates these teams met in the NLCS in multiple years. I then examine the game duration data provided in the tables for each of these series. By comparing the 'Time' column across all games listed in the relevant series tables, I can determine the maximum game duration. The game times listed are: 2:35, 2:14, 2:59, 2:39 (from 1977); 2:37, 2:06, 2:18, 2:53 (from 1978); 2:36, 3:33, 2:57, 3:44, 3:14 (from 2008); and 4:02, 3:05, 3:12, 3:44, 3:40 (from 2009).

    "question": "What is the birth year of the oldest professional beach volleyball player listed?",
    "reasoning": "To find the birth year of the oldest player, I need to identify all the professional beach volleyball players mentioned and their birth years. Then, I compare the birth years. The player with the minimum birth year is the oldest. The birth years found are 1983 (Bibiana Candelas), 1976 (Katsuhiro Shiratori), 1968 (Morais Abreu), 1967 (Emanuel Fernandes), 1979 (You Wenhui), 1974 (Ryoko Tokuno), and 1975 (Kentaro Asahi). Comparing these years (1983, 1976, 1968, 1967, 1979, 1974, 1975), the minimum birth year is 1967. Therefore, the oldest player listed was born in 1967.",

These years are 2012, 2013, and 2018. Then, find Lewis Hamilton's pole position time for each of these years: 1:20.953 for 2012, 1:19.388 for 2013, and 1:35.658 for 2018. Compare these three times to find the maximum (slowest) time. Converting to seconds for easier comparison: 1:20.953 = 80.953 seconds, 1:19.388 = 79.388 seconds, and 1:35.658 = 95.658 seconds.

    "reasoning": "First, identify the Formula One seasons where Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship based on the text evidence. The evidence states he won in 2002 (text_10) and 2003 (text_9). Next, examine the provided tables for these specific years. Table 81 lists drivers for the 2002 season, and Table 74 lists practice drivers for the 2003 season. Count the unique driver names listed in each table. Table 81 for 2002 lists 23 unique drivers. Table 74 for 2003 lists 7 unique practice drivers. Finally, identify any drivers that appear in both lists to avoid double-counting. Allan McNish is listed in both tables. Therefore, the total number of unique drivers across both tables is the sum of unique drivers in each table minus the number of overlapping drivers: 23 (from 2002) + 7 (from 2003) - 1 (Allan McNish) = 29.",

The 2018 season calendar lists 21 races. The 2019 season calendar lists 21 races. The number of races for 2014 is not explicitly provided in the evidence. Sorting the known race counts for Hamilton's championship seasons (2008, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019) from lowest to highest gives: 18 (2008), 19 (2015), 20 (2017), 21 (2018), 21 (2019). The second season in this sorted list is the 2015 season, which had 19 races.",
